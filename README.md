# CCC-Solutions
My AC solutions to previous and current problems from the University of Waterloo's Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)! Currently, all of my submissions are written in Python 3, and lack explanations for what the code does, and how to solve the problem step-by-step, however, I am currently working on this! In the near future, all submissions will have detailed explanations, and submissions in C++ are coming very soon!
